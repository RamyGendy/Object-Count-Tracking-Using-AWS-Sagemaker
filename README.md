# Object-Count-Tracking-Using-AWS-Sagemaker
Distribution centers often use robots to move objects during operation. I built using AWS SageMaker with ML engineering practices to fetch data from a database, preprocess it, and then train a ML model that can count the number of objects in each bin to track inventory and make sure that delivery consignments have the correct number of items.
