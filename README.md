# Project Overview: Object Count Tracking Using AWS Sagemaker

## Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers

Distribution centers often use robots to move objects as a part of their operations. Objects are carried in bins which can contain multiple objects.

In this project, a ML a model was built that can count the number of objects in each bin.

A system like this can be used to track inventory and make sure that delivery consignments have the correct number of items.

This project was build on AWS SageMaker and its services with good machine learning engineering practices to fetch data from a database, preprocess it, then proceed to train, refine, evaluate and validate a machine learning model.

 This project will serve as a demonstration of end-to-end machine learning engineering skills that you have learned as a part of this nanodegree.

## How it Works

To learn and complete this project. a dataset is needed. I used the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-bin-imagery/">Amazon Bin Image Dataset</a>. The dataset contains 500,000 images of bins containing one or more objects. For each image there is a metadata file containing information about the image like the number of objects, it's dimension and the type of object.

The target is to classify the number of objects in each bin.

A pre-trained convolutional neural network architecture was used to train the model using SageMaker notebook instances.

## Process Design

![ML Design Process](./starter/Images/ML-Design-Process.jpg)

1.Data preparation:

    a. Train data (Fetch, Preprocessing data and Split data into train, test & valid).
    b. Upload the data to S3 container
2.Training:

    a. Hyperparameters tuning.
    b. Train model.
    c. Profile, Debug and model (if there any anomalies and Improve with KPI metrics).
3.Deploy:

    a. Deploy the model.
    b. Test and valid the outcomes.

Here are the tasks you have to do in more detail:

## Setup AWS

1. Create a new Sagemaker Instance notebook with instance type `ml.t2.medium` For free tier.
2. While training: ml.m5.large or ml.m5.xlarge You can use different instance types for this project, but they might require additional permissions to the AWS cloud.

## Download the Starter Files

1. Fork this Github Repo.
2. Clone your Git repo in Sagemaker Git repo.
3. Navigate to Starter folder.

## Preparing Data

To build this project you will have to use the [Amazon Bin Images Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-bin-imagery/)

- Download the dataset: Since this is a large dataset, you have been provided with some code to download a small subset of that data. You are encouraged to use this subset to prevent any excess SageMaker credit usage.
- Preprocess and clean the files (if needed)
- Upload them to an S3 bucket so that SageMaker can use them for training
- OPTIONAL: Verify that the data has been uploaded correctly to the right bucket using the AWS S3 CLI or the S3 UI

### Data selection

In order to speed up training process only a portion of data was selected from the dataset.

- 1228 images with 1 items in it.
- 2299 images with 2 items in it.
- 2666 images with 3 items in it.
- 2373 images with 4 items in it.
- 1875 images with 5 items in it.

In total 10441 images were used. List of specific files is provided in `file_list.json` file.

Finally, split data into train, test and validation datasets with ratios 60%, 20% and 20% respectively before uploading to S3 Bucket.

### Sample overview

## Starter Code

Familiarize yourself with the following starter code

- [`sagemaker.ipynb`](./starter/sagemaker.ipynb) : Main project entiry notebook.
- [`train.py`](./starter/train.py) : Model training script.
- [`hpo.py`](./starter/hpo.py) : hyperparameters tuning script.
- [`inference.py`](./starter/inference.py) : Model inference and deployment script.

## Create a Training Script

details found in `train.py` script.

- Install necessary dependencies
- Read and Preprocess data: Before training your model, you will need to read, load and preprocess your training, testing and validation data
- Train your Model.

## Train using SageMaker

Found in in the `sagemaker.ipynb` notebook

- Setup the training estimator
- Submit the job
- Profile, Debug and model (if there any anomalies and Improve with KPI metrics).

## Model Deployment

Once you have trained your model, deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint and then query it with a test image to get a prediction.

## Standout Suggestions

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** To improve the performance of your model, can you use SageMakerâ€™s Hyperparameter Tuning to search through a hyperparameter space and get the value of the best hyperparameters.
- **Reduce Costs:** To reduce the cost of your machine learning engineering pipeline, you do a cost analysis and use spot instances to train model.
- **Multi-Instance Training:**  you train the same model, but this time distribute your training workload across multiple instances.
